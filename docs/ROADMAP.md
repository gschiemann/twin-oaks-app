_Last updated: 2026-08-10 (initial scaffold)._

## V1 — Financial core (SPEC §33)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Company setup | 🟡 | Single-company app, divisions FARM/TECH/SHARED baked in; no settings screen yet |
| Dashboard | ✅ | Month + YTD revenue/expenses/net, division cards, inbox alert, needs-attention flags, recent activity, tax set-aside planning number |
| Receipt capture | ✅ | Camera capture on iPhone/iPad (`capture="environment"`), photo/PDF upload, attach-later |
| Receipt storage | ✅ | Originals stored under `var/uploads` in dev via `src/lib/storage.ts`; swap to object storage for production (same interface) |
| Receipt Inbox | ✅ | Save instantly → categorize later; Inbox / Needs-review / All tabs |
| Expenses | ✅ | Full SPEC §5 record: dual categories, division, business purpose, asset link, tax year, tax status, capital flag |
| Income | ✅ | SPEC §25 categories, division, source |
| Categories | ✅ | Accounting + management levels (`src/lib/domain.ts` is the source of truth) |
| Equipment/assets | ✅ | SPEC §9 profile fields, ACTIVE/SOLD/RETIRED status |
| Equipment maintenance | ✅ | SPEC §10 history + categories, YTD/lifetime/cost-per-hour rollups, hour-meter sync |
| Search | ✅ | Multi-term AND search across expenses, receipts, income, assets, maintenance |
| Basic tax reports | ✅ | Tax Center: per-year totals, category breakdowns, division split, flagged items, capital list |
| Receipt drill-down | ✅ | Tax Center → expense → original receipt image (SPEC §26 example works end-to-end) |
| Data backup | 🟡 | One-tap full JSON export (`/api/export`); automatic scheduled backups still to come |

### V1 gaps / conscious deferrals

- **OCR auto-read of receipts** (SPEC §3 "attempt to automatically read") — deferred; fields are quick manual entry for now. Candidate: on-device/web OCR or AI extraction in a later pass.
- **Auth / secure login** (SPEC §32) — ✅ basic owner password gate shipped 2026-08-10 (`APP_PASSWORD` + signed 30-day session cookie, middleware-enforced on every route incl. APIs). Passkeys/Face ID still to come. **Set `APP_PASSWORD` on every deployment.**
- **Duplicate-receipt detection** (SPEC §4) — deferred.
- **Photos/manuals on equipment profiles** (SPEC §9) — document storage generalization comes with §31.
- **Outstanding invoices / upcoming bills on dashboard** — arrives with V2 invoicing.

## V2 — Customers, invoicing, mileage, banking (SPEC §34)

_Revenue-loop slice shipped 2026-08-11:_

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Customers | ✅ | Profiles (SPEC §14 contact fields), lifetime revenue + open balance rollups; deletable only when invoice-free |
| Invoices | ✅ | Draft → sent lifecycle, line-item editor, auto numbering (INV-NNN), sales tax, derived paid/partial/overdue status, printable/PDF view; drafts editable, sent invoices immutable |
| Payments | ✅ | Recorded against invoices; **auto-posts a linked Income row** (division-appropriate SPEC §25 category) so the books need no double entry; removing a payment removes its income row |
| Mileage | ✅ | SPEC §19 trips (odometer or direct miles), vehicle link advances Asset.currentMileage, YTD totals, Tax Center line. No auto-deduction math — rate is the accountant's call |
| Quotes | ✅ | `kind=QUOTE` on the Invoice table, `Q-NNN` numbering, no payments, printable "QUOTE" view, one-tap convert → fresh draft invoice (quote stamped ACCEPTED); excluded from every owed-money rollup |
| Accountant export (SPEC §28) | ✅ | Six per-year CSVs from the Tax Center: expenses, income, P&L (per-division + business miles), category totals, mileage, asset register. PDF/ZIP-with-receipt-images still to come |
| **Email-forwarded receipts** (SPEC §37) | ✅ | Forward a receipt to the inbound address → lands in the Receipt Inbox with vendor/total/tax/date/receipt-number auto-read, original email or attachment stored permanently. Provider-agnostic webhook (`/api/inbound/email/<secret>`) handling CloudMailin / Postmark / SendGrid / Mailgun JSON **and** multipart. Setup page at Settings → Email receipts |
| Bank transaction matching | ⬜ | Needs a sample bank CSV to build against |

## V3 — Farm / livestock (SPEC §35)

⬜ Sheep profiles · ⬜ Lambing · ⬜ Breeding · ⬜ Health records ·
⬜ Livestock sales · ⬜ Farm cost analysis

## V4 — Manufacturing (SPEC §36)

⬜ Print jobs · ⬜ Filament inventory · ⬜ Printer tracking · ⬜ Job costing ·
⬜ Production reporting · ⬜ Profit per part

## Platform follow-ups (not feature work)

- Auth: password gate ✅ (2026-08-10); Face ID via passkeys/WebAuthn still open
- Deploy readiness ✅ (2026-08-10): Postgres provider, Vercel Blob storage
  driver with local-disk dev fallback. Remaining: actual Vercel project +
  database provisioning (needs a Vercel token), private (non-public-URL) blob
  storage, PWA manifest + icons, automatic backups
- Upgrade path: Next.js 15 → 16 when the app stabilizes
